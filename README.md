# Kickstarter Anaylsis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in outcomes based on launch date and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
First we looked at Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on launch date. I created a pivot table from the dataset of campaigns and then filtered for results in theater. The table shows “successful”, “failed”, and “canceled” results based on the month the campaign was launched. I then created a line graph that is inserted below to demonstrate the results.

We then looked at Kickstarter campaign outcomes for plays based on pledge goals. First I made a table with ranges of different goal amounts and I organized “successful”, “failed”, and “canceled” results into each range. I found the percentage for each result and created a line graph. This shows what percentage of each goal range were “successful”, “failed”, or “canceled”.

One challenge that I encountered during this analysis was making sure that the pivot table I created had relevant data in it and the correct filters. 
## Results
* The most successful month to start a kickstarter campaign is May, and is closely followed by June. Either month would be a good time to launch a campaign. May also has the highest amount of failed campaigns, but failed campaigns look like they are spread more evenly throughout the months of the year, and May still has the highest success rate. 
* Based on campaign goals for plays, the highest success rate is in the less than $1000 category. Campaigns that have goals between $1000 and $4999 are also very successful. 
* Some limitations to the data are that in our first graph there is a higher total number of campaigns in May and June, and we did not look at a percent successful for those months compared to others. I think that information could add some more context of best and worst months to launch a kickstarter campaign. In the line graph, “Outcomes Based on Goals”, $35,000 to $44,999 looks like a very successful goal amount for campaigns but it is a small total number and might not be as reliable. 
* We could create another graph looking at the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns by month for “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date.”
